                            The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old,
                            found in both the Franco-Cantabrian region in western Europe,
                            and in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia).
                            However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in Arnhem Land,
                            in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites,
                            there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old.
                            There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Indonesia, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, China ,India, Australia, Mexico, etc.
                            In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter.
                            In the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.
                            The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first photograph was produced in 1829,
                            photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced,
                            depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world.

                        Aesthetics is the study of art and beauty;
                        it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century philosophers such as Kant and Hegel.
                        Classical philosophers like Plato and Aristotle also theorized about art and painting in particular.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1890, the Parisian painter Maurice Denis famously asserted:
                        <b>
                            "Remember that a painting—before being a warhorse, a naked woman or some story or other—is essentially
                            a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order."
                        </b>
                        <br><br>
                        Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system;
                        he maintained that painting cannot depict the truth—it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas)
                        and is nothing but a craft, similar to shoemaking or iron casting.
                        <br><br>
                        In Mirror of The World, Bell writes:
                        <b>
                            A work of art seeks to hold your attention and keep it fixed: a history of art urges it onwards,
                            bulldozing a highway through the homes of the imagination.

                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">Allegory is a figurative mode of representation conveying meaning other than the literal. Allegory communicates its message by means of symbolic figures, actions, or symbolic representation.</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still life painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern.</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">A figure painting is a work of art in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or nude.</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">Illustration paintings are those used as illustrations in books, magazines, and theater or movie posters and comic books. Today, there is a growing interest in collecting and admiring the original artwork.</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">Landscape painting is a term that covers the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, lakes, and forests, and especially art where the main subject is a wide view, with its elements arranged into a coherent composition.</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">Portrait paintings are representations of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person.</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">A still life is a work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects—which may be either natural (food, flowers, plants, rocks, or shells) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on).</td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid black;">A veduta is a highly detailed, usually large-scale painting of a cityscape or some other vista. This genre of landscape originated in Flanders, where artists such as Paul Bril painted vedute as early as the 16th century.</td>
