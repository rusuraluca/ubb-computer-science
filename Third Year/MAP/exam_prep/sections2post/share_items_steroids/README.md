Steps to run the server:

- Clone the exam repo
- Change the directory to server: cd server
- Update the npm dependencies by running: npm install
- Execute the server, using: npm start

Don't forget to replace the url for the server in api.dart with your own. If you're running on your own phone (Android), enter the following command in terminal:
```adb reverse tcp:2325 tcp:2325```
