"","/hamiltonean_cyle_bits.cpp","","42:0-105:1","Concerns regarding thread safety and resource management","The implementation uses threading to potentially speed up the search for a Hamiltonian cycle by dividing the work among two threads. However, there are several concerns regarding thread safety and resource management:\n\n- The global variable **T** is accessed and modified by multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms (other than **mtx.lock()** and **mtx.unlock()**), which could lead to race conditions. Consider using **std::atomic<int>** for **T** or applying more granular locking strategies.\n- Thread exceptions are not handled. If a thread throws an exception, it will lead to **std::terminate()** being called, as the exception is not caught. Consider wrapping the thread's entry function in a try-catch block or using **std::async** which can propagate exceptions back to the main thread.\n- There's a fixed limit of **NO_THREADS**, but there's no dynamic scaling based on the actual hardware capabilities. Utilizing **std::thread::hardware_concurrency()** might provide a more flexible way to determine the number of threads that can be run simultaneously.","3","Best Practices","std::async, std::atomic<int>, std::thread::hardware_concurrency()","cc62f828-fe66-4c88-9831-259b65dd9674","0"
"","/hamiltonean_cyle_bits.cpp","","44:4-44:21","Bitwise operations","The use of bitwise operations for marking visited nodes (x |= (1 << node)) is limited by the size of an int or long long, which restricts the maximum number of nodes (n) the algorithm can handle correctly. For graphs with more than 64 nodes (assuming long long is used), this method will fail. Consider using a std::vector<bool> or a bitset for larger graphs.","1","Reliability","std::vector<bool>","a8e51e52-6ad9-41f0-bc17-b5b4016a57c9","0"
